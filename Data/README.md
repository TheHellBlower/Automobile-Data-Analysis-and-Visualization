The entire final data can be loaded by simply loading "Cars_Data.RData". Apart from this, there is data for all the car images which is in the "www" folder in the "ShinyApp" folder. "Cars100_Data.R" contains majority of the code for scraping while the code for scraping and downloading the images is in "Images.R".
